# üéì AI Interview Coach
## Project Overview
The AI Interview Coach is a dynamic web application designed to help students and job seekers practice their interview skills and receive intelligent, real-time feedback. Leveraging cutting-edge AI models, sentiment analysis, and conceptual facial emotion detection, this tool provides a comprehensive platform for improving interview performance and building confidence.
---
## ‚ú® Features
* **Intelligent Feedback Engine:**
    * Analyzes user answers using **Google Gemini API** (specifically `gemini-2.0-flash`).
    * Provides detailed feedback on content, structure, clarity, conciseness, impact, strengths, and areas for improvement.
    * Offers an overall rating for the answer.
* **Sentiment Analysis:**
    * Analyzes the emotional tone (polarity) and objectivity (subjectivity) of your answers using **TextBlob**.
    * Visualizes sentiment scores with clear bar charts.
* **Facial Emotion Detection (Single Image):**
    * Captures a single image from your webcam using Streamlit's `st.camera_input`.
    * Analyzes facial expressions for dominant emotions (e.g., happy, sad, neutral) and provides probability scores using **DeepFace** and **OpenCV**.
    * *Note: Real-time video emotion detection is a complex feature for cloud deployment and is handled as a single-image analysis for practicality.*
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive and interactive web experience.
* **Category Selection:** Choose from various interview question categories (HR, Technical, Behavioral, Product Management, Data Science) to tailor your practice.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
* **Frontend/UI:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
* **AI Model (Text Generation):** [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) (`gemini-2.0-flash`)
* **Sentiment Analysis:** [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/)
* **Facial Analysis:** [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)
* **Image Processing:** [OpenCV (`opencv-python`)](https://opencv.org/)
* **Numerical Operations:** [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* **Plotting:** [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* **API Requests:** [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* **Keras Backend:** [tf-keras](https://pypi.org/project/tf-keras/) (for TensorFlow 2.11+ compatibility with DeepFace)
---
## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get your AI Interview Coach up and running on your local machine.
### **1. Prerequisites**
* **Python 3.8+** installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
### **2. Clone the Repository**
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-interview-coach.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-interview-coach.git)
cd ai-interview-coach
(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username and ai-interview-coach if you name your repository differently.)
3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)
It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
	‚Ä¢ Create the virtual environment:
Bash

python -m venv venv
	‚Ä¢ Activate the virtual environment:
		‚óã On Windows (Command Prompt):
Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
		‚óã On Windows (PowerShell):
PowerShell

. .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

(If you encounter an error about script execution, you might need to run Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser once in PowerShell and confirm with Y.)
		‚óã On macOS/Linux:
Bash

source venv/bin/activate

Your terminal prompt should now show (venv) at the beginning, indicating the virtual environment is active.
4. Install Dependencies
With your virtual environment activated, install all the required Python libraries:
Bash

pip install streamlit textblob requests matplotlib numpy opencv-python deepface tf-keras
Important Notes on Dependencies:
	‚Ä¢ tf-keras: This package is crucial for deepface to work correctly with newer versions of TensorFlow (2.11 and above). The error ValueError: You have tensorflow X.Y.Z and this requires tf-keras package indicates this specific need.
	‚Ä¢ DeepFace Models: The first time you run the application and use the emotion detection feature, DeepFace will automatically download its pre-trained models. This requires an active internet connection and might take a few moments.
5. Set Up Your Google Gemini API Key
For security and ease of deployment (especially on Streamlit Cloud), it's recommended to store your API key using Streamlit's secrets.toml.
	‚Ä¢ Create a .streamlit directory: Inside your project's root directory (where app.py is), create a new folder named .streamlit.
	‚Ä¢ Create secrets.toml: Inside the .streamlit folder, create a file named secrets.toml.
	‚Ä¢ Add your API key: Open secrets.toml and add the following line, replacing "YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" with the API key you obtained from Google AI Studio:
Ini, TOML

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
gemini_api_key = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
Once all dependencies are installed and your API key is set up, you can run the Streamlit application:
	1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated (as described in Step 3 of Setup).
	2. Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal.
	3. Run the Streamlit app:
Bash

python -m streamlit run app.py

This command will open the AI Interview Coach in your default web browser.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
	‚Ä¢ Local vs. Cloud Deployment for Emotion Detection:
		‚óã The facial emotion detection feature uses st.camera_input to analyze a single image. This approach is designed to be compatible with cloud deployments like Streamlit Cloud, as direct real-time webcam video streaming and processing from the server side are challenging due to browser security and computational limits.
		‚óã For truly real-time, continuous facial emotion analysis, a more complex architecture involving client-side JavaScript for video processing or a dedicated local application would be required.
	‚Ä¢ API Key Security: Never hardcode your API keys directly into app.py. Always use environment variables or Streamlit Secrets (secrets.toml) for secure handling.
	‚Ä¢ Disclaimer: This tool provides AI-generated feedback and is intended for practice purposes only. It should not be considered a substitute for professional career advice or human feedback.
